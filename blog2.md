## Frameworks that Use C#

C# is a popular programming language that is widely used in the development of a variety of applications. It is a high level recently developed, object-oriented programming language that is designed to be smooth to utilise and maintain. It is supported by a massive number of frameworks that make it attractive to build and deploy applications.

One of the most popular frameworks for building applications with C# is the .NET Framework. This comprehensive framework includes a large class library of pre-built code that can be used to build a wide range of applications, including desktop, web, and mobile. The .NET Framework is established by Microsoft and is available on Windows, Linux, and macOS. This cross platform supporting update enhances the popularity. 

Another framework that supports the use of C# is ASP.NET. This is a web application framework that is built on top of the .NET Framework and is designed specifically for building dynamic websites, web APIs, and web services. ASP.NET uses a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the application into three distinct layers,

* The model
* The view
* The controller. 

This enables users to manage the complexity of large web applications and allows developers to focus on specific parts of the application.

Apart from these well known frameworks, C# is also supported by Xamarin. It a cross-platform mobile development framework that allows developers to build native mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows using C# and the .NET Framework. C# is also used in the Unity game engine, which is used to develop 2D and 3D games for a variety of platforms. Mono is also supported by C#. Which is an open-source implementation of the .NET Framework that can be used to build cross-platform applications. Mono is commonly used on Linux and macOS.
